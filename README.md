# BlackJack Game



# Description

Skill Distillery -   Week 3 Project: BlackJack

This BlackJack game is a simulation of BlackJack at a table. The player is dealt two cards face up while the dealer is dealt two cards with one face down. The player chooses to either hit "take another card" or stand "not take another card" based on their hand. The goal of the game is to have more points then the dealer without going over 21. If the player is dealt 21 to start the game this is a blackjack. If the dealer does not have blackjack, the player wins. If the dealer also has blackjack it is a tie.

# Lessons Learned# BlackjackProject

I have a much better understanding of OOP after this project, how the classes work together and why and when they are needed. The use of the enums added extra challenge but it was good to see them in practice and how using them is a benefit. 

Using the UML was not only educational it was imperative. Without a blueprint/ map I know I wouldn't have been able to grasp the project and I would have struggled with the classes. Although we didn't have a full UML at the start I spent many hours building out the UML and planning the project on paper before I started writing code.
 
 The Ascii art I added was my first attempt at adding it. I felt like I had a good enough grasp on the programming that I had enough time to add some flare.
